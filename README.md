# Southern California Earthquake Center Internship 2022-2023

# Overview
This repository documents my research and accomplishments during my internship with the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) in the Summer and Fall of 2022. The research was conducted in two phases:

- **Summer 2022:** Focused on low-resolution seismic simulations using SW4 software on a MacBook Pro.
- **Fall 2022 - Winter 2023:** Focused on high-resolution seismic simulations using the ARCH Rockfish supercomputing cluster. This phase included a detailed analysis and scaling study, culminating in a technical paper.

This repository includes the simulations, poster, paper, scripts, and documentation related to the research.

# Table of Contents

- [Simulations](#simulations)

# Scripts
The `/scripts/` directory contains a sample of scripts I developed or utilized during my internship. Each script is documented with comments to explain its purpose and usage. All scripts used for were jointly built with my advisor, [John Louie, PhD, Chief Geophysicist | Terēan™](https://www.louie.pub/). Many scripts were created for this research which varied per architecture, model and system specification.

# Software Used
- [Adapter](https://macroplant.com/adapter)
- [SW4 2.01](https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/sw4/)
- [JRGViewmat](https://zenodo.org/records/6635764)
- [Google Earth](https://earth.google.com/intl/earth/versions/)
- [Seismic Analysis Code (SAC)](https://ds.iris.edu/files/sac-manual/)

# Documentation
The `/docs/` directory contains resources and additional documentation related to the research.

# Reports and Posters
The `/reports-posters/` directory contains my 2022 Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) Annual Meeting poster, 2023 Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI) poster, a comprehensive updated guide for SW4 software installation, and "Exploring the SW4 Synthetic Seismic Performance of the ARCH Rockfish Cluster" technical paper.

# Simulations
The `/simulations/` directory contains example data and results for 0.6Hz (low-resolution) and 1.5Hz (high-resolution) simluations. Many simulations were created and analyzed for this research with varying epicenter locations, minimum velocity, frequency, earthquake magnitude and basin depth models. 

This repository serves as a comprehensive record of my research experience with SCEC, providing insights into the seismic modeling tasks I completed and the knowledge gained. I hope it can be a valuable resource for anyone interested in similar work or future interns. Feel free to explore the repository, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!
