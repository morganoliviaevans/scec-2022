# Southern California Earthquake Center Research Internship, Summer & Fall 2022

# Overview
This repository documents my research and accomplishments during my internship with the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) in the Summer and Fall of 2022. The research was conducted in two phases:

**Summer 2022:** Focused on low-resolution seismic simulations using SW4 software on a MacBook Pro.
**Fall 2022:** Focused on high-resolution seismic simulations using the ARCH Rockfish supercomputing cluster. This phase included a detailed analysis and scaling study, culminating in a final paper.

This repository includes the simulations, poster, paper, scripts, and documentation related to the research.

# Low-Resolution Simulations
The `/low-resolution-simulations/` directory contains simulation data and results from the summer research phase, focusing on low-resolution seismic modeling using a MacBook Pro. The poster presented at the 2022 SCEC Annual Meeting is also included here.

# Objective 2: Fall Research - High-Resolution Simulations
The `/high-resolution-simulations/` directory contains high-resolution simulations performed during the fall research phase using the ARCH Rockfish cluster. This includes scaling analysis, performance results, and the final paper summarizing the findings.

# Scripts
The `/low-resolution-scripts/` and `/high-resolution-scripts/` directories include all scripts used during the research phases, organized by project. Each script is documented with comments explaining its purpose and usage.

# Software Used
**SW4:** [SW4 Software](https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/sw4/)

# Reports and Documentation
The `/low-resolution-docs/` and `/high-resolution-docs/` directories contain detailed build instructions, references, and additional documentation related to the research.

This repository serves as a comprehensive record of my research experience with SCEC, providing insights into the seismic modeling tasks I completed and the knowledge gained. I hope it can be a valuable resource for anyone interested in similar work or future interns. Feel free to explore the repository, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!
